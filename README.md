# Python Biopython & Bioinformatics Workshop
This repository contains all necessary data for my Bioinformatics workshop.

This is **not** an introductory Python workshop. There's one of those [here](https://github.com/vsojo/Python_Workshop).

The contents of the `.ZIP` and `.TAR.GZ` files are identical. Just pick whichever you prefer.

The workshop introduces multiple basic bioinformatics topics, chiefly using BioPython, including:
1. Accessing NCBI databases.
1. Readaing and writing sequences with BioPython.
1. Aligning sequences (with MAFFT or Clustal-Omega).
1. Building phylogenetic trees (with FastTree or IQ-Tree).
1. Parsing those trees and creating images with ETE-3.

:pencil: I am always very happy to receive comments and suggestions for improvement at vsojo@amnh.org

Please do read the specifications of the license but, in brief, this means that I'm happy for you to use any of this stuff in your own work or teaching. If you do redistribute it, though -- whether you change it a little or a lot or leave it exactly as is -- you must credit the original, and you must _never ever_ make any money off of the document itself, even if you make a lot of changes to it. You can of course get paid for teaching, but it must be clear to students that the documents themselves are all free (in both cost and access). Again, this applies both to my originals and to anything you make from them.
